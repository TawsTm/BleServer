# BleServer
###### A little Server to handle Request of Devices that interact in a BLE Installation.

To start the server on Port 3030:
```
npm start run
nodemon start run
```
A localtunnel is created so that the WebSocket can be accessed via ws://blebeacon.loca.lt

The index.html needs to be startet on a Live Server to catch the ws on Port 2000
